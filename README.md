# University Domination

Updated from [Nicodaw/Uni-UniversityDominationA4](https://github.com/Nicodaw/Uni-UniversityDominationA4).

## Building

The project includes building scripts to aid with the building for all platforms. There is a windows version (`build.cmd`), however the Makefile provides much more extensive building features and options. The build scripts current output builds for all supported platforms, and the Makefile also archives them into zip files to allow quick uploading to a host. The builds for the original version can be found [here](https://starmix.devsprime.com/Projects/4/Builds).
