## Building

The project includes building scripts to aid with the building for all platforms. There is a windows version (`build.cmd`), however the Makefile provides much more extensive building features and options. The build scripts current output builds for all supported platforms (as show by the [builds](https://starmix.devsprime.com/Projects/4/Builds) page on our site), and the Makefile also archives them into zip files to allow quick uploading to a host.
